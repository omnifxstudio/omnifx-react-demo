# 💬 We’d Love Your Feedback

Hey there — thanks for exploring **OMNI-FX**.  
Every icon, motion, and line of code here exists to make digital interfaces more alive. But we can only evolve if we hear from the people who actually use our work — you.

Whether it’s a quick thought, detailed review, or just something you wish worked differently, your feedback means everything.  
Tell us what felt great, what could be smoother, or what you’d like to see next.
